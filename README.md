# Android Malware Detection using Machine Learning

## Introduction
This Jupyter Notebook provides a step-by-step guide for building a machine learning model to detect Android malware. The notebook covers the following main tasks:

1. Data Collection: It fetches datasets from Kaggle, including static analysis of Android malware and benign apps from 2017.

2. Feature Extraction: Extracts features (permissions and intents) from the collected datasets.

3. Data Preprocessing: Performs data preprocessing, feature selection, and splits the dataset into training and testing sets.

4. Model Training: Builds and trains a machine learning model for Android malware detection.

5. Model Evaluation: Evaluates the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

6. Model Export: Saves the trained model in both TensorFlow SavedModel format and TensorFlow Lite (tflite) format.

7. Model Testing: Demonstrates how to test the model using a random sample from the dataset.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- This notebook is designed to run in a Google Colab environment.
- You need a Kaggle account and API key to download datasets.

### Setup
1. Create a Kaggle account and generate an API token (`kaggle.json`).
2. Upload the `kaggle.json` API token to your Colab environment.
3. Run the code cells in the notebook step by step to perform the following tasks:
   - Download datasets.
   - Extract features from the datasets.
   - Select relevant features.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Train a machine learning model.
   - Evaluate the model's performance.
   - Save the model.

### Testing the Model
After training and saving the model, you can use it to make predictions. The notebook provides code to test the model with a randomly selected sample.
